2. Create a Virtual Environment & Install Dependencies
It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.


# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it (Windows)
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate it (macOS/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate

# Install the required libraries
pip install streamlit pandas matplotlib

3. Set Up the Database
This command will create the data_buku.db file and populate it with some initial example data. You only need to run this once.
Bash
python setup_db.py

4. Run the Streamlit App
Now, you can start the application.
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
Your web browser should automatically open with the application running.
